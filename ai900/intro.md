# Gen AI:
- branch of AI that enables software apps to generate content
- ability to generate content is based on a language model that was trained with a large volume of data - docs from the internet
- llm, slm - differs in the volume of data and number of variables in the model
- llm - costly to train, more general. slm - more focussed on specific topics, costs less.
- Gen AI models encapsulate the semantic relation between language elements

- Scenarios:
    - chatbots, AI Agents
    - create new docs or other content
    - automated transation of text between languages
    - summarizing or explaining complex docs

# Computer Vision:
- training a model with large number of images
- forms of computer vision:
    - image classification - form of computer vision where model is trained with images lageled with main subject of image - so that it can analyse unlabeled images and predict the most apt label
    - object detection - identify an object within an object - location of an object
    - semamtic segmentation - advanced form of object detection - where the model identifies the pixels associated with an object
- combine computer vision and llm to create multi-modal model that combines computer vision and gen ai capabilities
- Scenarios:
    - auto captioning / tag-generation for photos
    - visual search
    - monitoring stock level/ identifying items for checkout in retail stores
    - security video monitoring
    - facial recognition auth
    - robotics and self driving cars

# Speech:
- Speech recognition - speech to text
- Speech synthesis - text to speech - vocalizing words as spoken language
- challenges - ignore background noise, detecting interruptions, generate increasingly expressive and human-like voices

- Scenarios:
    - personal AI assistants
    - automated transcription of calls and meetings
    - automated audio descriptions of video or text
    - automated speech translation between languages

# NLP:
- based on models trained to do particular type of text analysis
- nlp proves to cost effective for a few scenarios when compared to gen ai llm:
    - entity extraction - identifying mentions of entities - people, places, orgs, 
    - text classification - assigning doc to a category
    - sentiment analysis - deciphering whether text is positive, negative, neutral
    - language detection - identifying language of text

- Scenarios:
    - implementing chatbots for faq
    - social media comment analysis - for sentiment analysis
    - analyse meeting transcripts for entity extraction

# Extract data and insights:
- OCR - Optical Character Recognition - computer vision tech - basis for doc analysis
- OCR model identifies the location of text in an image, advanced models can interpret individual values in doc

- Scenarios:
    - automated processing of forms and other docs
    - large scale digitisation of data from paper forms
    - indexing docs for search
    - identifying key points and follow up actions from meeting transcripts or recordings

# Responsible AI:
- Fairness
- Reliability and Safety
- Privacy and Security
- Inclusiveness
- Transparency
- Accountability
